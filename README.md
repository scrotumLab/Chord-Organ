# Chord Organ
Adaptation of the Chord Organ code for Radio Music v3.x.
The [original code](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Chord-Organ/releases) was changed to work with the Scrotum Lab version of the Radio Music module which adds mixing & attenuation to the original circuit.

The original code can be found here: https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Chord-Organ/releases
